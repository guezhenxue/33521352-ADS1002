## Reflective Journal Week 5
# What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

By Week 5 of Semester 2, 2024, our ADS1002 group project has made significant strides in data cleaning, merging datasets, and discussing time series data handling. Initially, our primary focus was on cleaning the data by removing all N/A values and merging train and test datasets. This foundational work was crucial for setting up the project, but it also highlighted potential challenges, such as the potential loss of valuable information due to the removal of missing values.

My role in the group has evolved from assisting with data cleaning to a more strategic position involving planning and problem-solving. This shift has brought its own set of challenges, including addressing the need for data imputation to avoid compromising model accuracy and developing effective methods for visualising and summarising time series data.

As we progress, it is essential to implement data pipelines for cleaning and address the complexities of time series analysis. To success in this project, we must continue to collaborate closely, review our approach, and adapt strategies as necessary.
