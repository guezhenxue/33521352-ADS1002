## Reflective Journal Week 5
### What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

By Week 5 of Semester 2, our group successfully cleaned the data by removing N/A values, merged the train and test datasets, and began discussions on handling time series data. We are now focusing on completing pipelines for data cleaning, visualising time series data, and conducting data modelling. I feel a sense of achievement for the progress made so far but am concerned about the remaining tasks. Specifically, the challenge of data imputation and the complexity of time series analysis weigh heavily on me.

The initial success in data cleaning and merging has laid a strong foundation. However, dropping N/A values might compromise model accuracy. Effectively visualising time series data is still a challenge for us. As the project goes on, my role has expanded from task execution to strategic planning and problem-solving. The challenges require careful application of techniques and clear communication within the group.

To success in this project, we must continue to collaborate closely, review our approach, and adapt strategies as necessary.
