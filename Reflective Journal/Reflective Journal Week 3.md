## Reflective Journal Week 3 
### Topic: ADS1002 Project

In Week 3, our group noticed the addition of a section regarding the group project. The project topics included "Temperature and Energy Demand," "Mortality in ICUs," and "Analysis of Rossmann Drugstore Sales." We were astonished and surprised to realise that compared to the previous semester, specific requirements are being asked in the group project.  We held a vote to determine our preferred topic, and "Temperature and Energy Demand" appeared to be the most favourable among the group.

When exploring the project details and requirements, we discussed on what could be achieved and what would need to be demonstrated. As well-written code is a major requirement of the project, we revisited our group project from the last semester to identify areas for improvement. This reflection led to a decision to build a pipeline before doing data analysis. This is to ensure that our code remains consistent and concise throughout the project.

Personally, I found the initial stages of the project to be both exciting and challenging. The shift in project structure compared to last semester required adaptability, but our group's collaborative approach made it manageable. By reflecting on our previous experiences and actively contributing to discussions, I maintained my commitment to the project and supported the team's efforts to develop a strong foundation for our work. This proactive approach has helped me navigate the challenges and remain focused on achieving our collective goals.
