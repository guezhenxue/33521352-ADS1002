## Reflective Journal Week 9

### What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

In Weeks 8 and 9, I continued playing an active role in preparing my group for the upcoming mock presentation in Week 10. Our group members are roughly prepared. We have organised a PowerPoint slide and practised the presentation multiple times to ensure the quality is up to standard. Initially, my role involved assisting with research and slide creation. Over the semester, it has evolved into a more collaborative role, as we all contribute equally to the projectâ€™s success.

I feel excited and motivated as the presentation approaches. The progress we have made as a team is encouraging, and I am eager to showcase our hard work. The regular practice sessions have increased my confidence in our ability to deliver a strong presentation. However, we have encountered some challenges, particularly with the careful application of data science techniques and maintaining clear communication within the group.

We addressed these challenges by constantly reviewing our approach and practising to refine our work. This experience has shown me the importance of consistent collaboration and open communication to ensure everyone is aligned. To succeed in this project, we must continue working closely, reviewing our strategies, and adapting when necessary. I will remain committed to supporting the team as we build a strong foundation for our presentation and the overall project.
