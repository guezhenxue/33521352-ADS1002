## Reflective Journal Week 7
### What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

By Week 7 of the semester, our group had successfully completed data cleaning (including imputation), time series analysis, and multiple linear regression (MLR). My focus during this period was on MLR.

Initially, I felt a strong sense of accomplishment as our foundational work in data cleaning and analysis set the stage for our progress. Despite these efforts, we encountered overfitting, evident from an R² value of 0.9. Although the high R² value suggested a good fit, it also indicated that our model might be too complex, leading to poor generalisation on new data.

The effectiveness of our initial techniques, such as determining important variables from correlations and applying regularisation, was clear. However, the overfitting issue revealed the need for more advanced methods. This experience highlighted the importance of adapting our approach and continuously evaluating our model's performance. It became clear that techniques like cross-validation might be necessary to address the overfitting problem.

Looking ahead, I plan to implement cross-validation and explore additional regularisation methods to enhance model accuracy. This experience has reinforced the value of flexibility, collaboration, and iterative testing in overcoming challenges and refining our data modelling strategies. By focusing on these areas, I aim to better handle similar issues in future projects.
