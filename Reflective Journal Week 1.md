  Reflecting on the group project experience from weeks 6 to 12 in ADS1001, it had been a journey of growth and learning. Initially, the introduction to the project, with a choice between Malaysia house rental pricing and weather forecasting, had left me feeling both overwhelmed and excited. I chose the topic of house rental pricing project, as it suited my interests, and was eager to tackle the tasks ahead.

The project began with an exploration of the complex dataset, which required significant manipulation. Our team faced challenges in identifying relevant questions, cleaning invalid data, and dealing with incorrect column titles. These issues required careful attention and collaborative effort. When it comes to deciding the main topic, we decided to take a focus on "Factors that influence Malaysia housing prices‚Äù.

As we moved into the final weeks, preparing for the presentation became our priority. I worked closely with teammates, especially Max, that, we focused on designing a clear and simple poster to effectively communicate our findings. As we wanted to present our data and analysis confidently, we ensured accuracy and clarity in the presentation slides and notebook, and fortunately, the presentation worked well, and we gained a high grade of the project at the end. 

In conclusion, this project experience has been a valuable learning opportunity. It fostered my ability to work under pressure, collaborate with a team, and handle complex data. The positive feedback we received affirmed our hard work and dedication. Thus, still, I look forward to continuing to grow in the unit of ADS1002.
